The rear wheel is harder than the rubber in the classic skis because the scrubbing motion in skating reduces tire life. The front ratchet wheel is narrower than the wheel used on the 900 classic skis and has a more crowned profile for better skate characteristics. The result is a ski that performs exceptionally well for both classic and skate skiing. The 940C has been in our lineup for several years and is still one of our best sellers'),

(8, '900 SERIES',	NULL,	9270.00,	'This very popular classic ski has been in our lineup since the 1990’s and is still a favorite of many skiers. The 900 series utilize an aluminum shaft and composite polymer fork and fender that easily accepts the ATRA speed reducer and doubles as a fender for wet conditions. Available in 3 rolling resistances and 1 combi model, the 910 is slow, the 920 medium-slow and the 930 medium. The preferred model for the average skier is the 930 and for World Cup skiers the 910.'),

Another major benefit is that the Speed Reducers on pneumatic tires are much more effective than when used on solid rubber wheels. Because the Speed Reducers are so effective on the Aero the skis have become popular in very hilly or mountainous terrain. The XL125RC is a very stable classic ski with two 125mm pneumatic wheels in the back and a 150mm one way clutch wheel in the front making it very easy to balance on. The pneumatic wheels make it ideal for hard packed dirt roads and bike paths and are exceptionally smooth on pavement.

(8, 'XL9848',		NULL,	10170.00,	'A Contemporary Terra ski. The old Terra was stable and could be used on both paved and on hard packed dirt roads. However, we were forced to discontinue the Terra as our wheel supplier was unable to provide product in a predictable manner. The Terra was Kristina Smigun’s favorite classic ski. She was a double Olympic Gold medalist in 2006 and after giving birth to daughter Victoria in 2008, and not racing for two seasons, she captured Olympic Silver in 2010. An amazing skier and wonderful person. Many skiers told me the Terra was too heavy for proper training, but Olympic results show otherwise. Just like Kristina, two other Olympic medalists used the Terra for classic training. In the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Olympics Kristina and her Terra training ski mates captured four Gold, one Silver and one Bronze medal. Kristina told me the Terra made her stronger than training on lighter smaller wheel classic skis. We began to ship the XL9848 in April of 2011 and it’s turning out to be one of our best selling classic skis. This season the XL9848 is only available with an aluminum shaft, but when we have increased composite capacity we might be able to offer the XL9848 with a composite shaft. With the wide wheels it’s stable and the 98 mm wheels provide a comfortable ride. It’s also safer than smaller wheel skis as the larger wheels can roll over objects that stop the 70 to 80 mm wheels. Like all XL skis this model accepts the lighter and less expensive XL type Brake.'),
(8, 'XL98RC',		NULL,	11370.00,	'This classic ski is very stable and is a great choice for beginning classic skiers or someone looking for a stable, 3 wheeled classic ski for good pavement.

Designed for rough pavement and dirt paths and trails, the composite version provides excellent vibration dampening offering a smoother and quieter ride than the aluminum version.

The 800’s use a solid rubber wheel 33mm wide and 70mm in diameter with a highly crowned profile for skating.

The XL125S is much like the XL150S but uses a smaller 125mm wheel which makes it about 100 grams lighter than the XL150S, and many people find it is easier to balance on. Many lighter skiers and those with very good technique prefer it to the XL150S but skiers over 170 pounds will want the XL150 as the larger wheels wear better and are more reliable'),

(9, 'XL98R',		NULL,	10170.00,	'The performance of this ski is simply outstanding. Many prominent coaches and skiers told us the XL98R was the most snow like roller ski they have ever tried. Over the last year we have perfected the ultra light composite shaft. This is a true carbon composite where both unidirectional and biaxial carbon graphite are combined with a specially constructed core that dramatically reduces vibration. The snow like feel of the XL98R has spread rapidly in the ski community and people who have not roller skied for many years are buying the ski based on comments from other users. Another benefit of the XL98R is the ability to select 3 different rolling speeds while using the same durable tires. With the ISR (Internal Speed Reducer) which was just granted a patent, we can increase the rolling resistance by about 15%. The XL98RM uses all medium speed wheels, the XL98RS all slow wheels and the XL98RMS uses two slow and two medium wheels. This is the only 100 mm wheel roller ski that can be fitted with very effective Speed Reducers and a Brake.'),
(9, 'XL98SL',		NULL,	5970.00,	'This extremely popular skate ski has an improved aluminum shaft making it lighter and more responsive than ever.
