(7, '800 Series', NULL, 'One of our original skate skis and still a very popular model especially in Europe and Japan. The 800’s use a solid rubber wheel 33mm wide and 70mm in diameter with a highly crowned profile for skating. Due to the short shaft and 33mm wide wheel they are easy to balance on and are a good choice for beginners. Available in 2 speeds the 850 is about 15% faster than the 830.', 7770.00),
(7, 'AERO XL125S', NULL, 'The V2 Aero roller skis are the most versatile roller skis available. The large diameter pneumatic wheels can be used on surfaces where it’s impossible to roller ski on smaller diameter solid wheels. The skis can be used on dirt roads, limestone bicycle path’s, chip seal pavement and on grass. On normal pavement the pneumatic tires provide an extremely smooth ride. Many users consider the Aero safer as they will roll over debris that can stop smaller wheels. Another major benefit is that the Speed Reducers on pneumatic tires are much more effective than when used on solid rubber wheels. Because the Speed Reducers are so effective on the Aero the skis have become popular in very hilly or mountainous terrain. The XL125S is much like the XL150S but uses a smaller 125mm wheel which makes it about 100 grams lighter than the XL150S, and many people find it is easier to balance on. Many lighter skiers and those with very good technique prefer it to the XL150S but skiers over 170 pounds will want the XL150 as the larger wheels wear better and are more reliable', 9870.00),

The original Aero with the 150mm pneumatic wheels can cover terrain impossible with any other roller ski. The large 150mm pneumatic wheels easily roll over road debris and provide a very smooth ride. Despite the large wheel size the XL150S is very light at only 2000g per pair, which is why so many say the XL150S is their favorite roller ski.', 9870.00),
(7, 'XL98R', NULL, 'The performance of this ski is simply outstanding. Many prominent coaches and skiers told us the XL98R was the most snow like roller ski they have ever tried. Over the last year we have perfected the ultra light composite shaft. This is a true carbon composite where both unidirectional and biaxial carbon graphite are combined with a specially constructed core that dramatically reduces vibration. The snow like feel of the XL98R has spread rapidly in the ski community and people who have not roller skied for many years are buying the ski based on comments from other users. Another benefit of the XL98R is the ability to select 3 different rolling speeds while using the same durable tires. With the ISR (Internal Speed Reducer) which was just granted a patent, we can increase the rolling resistance by about 15%. The XL98RM uses all medium speed wheels, the XL98RS all slow wheels and the XL98RMS uses two slow and two medium wheels. This is the only 100 mm wheel roller ski that can be fitted with very effective Speed Reducers and a Brake.', 10170.00),
(7, 'XL98SL', NULL, 'This extremely popular skate ski has an improved aluminum shaft making it lighter and more responsive than ever. It uses the same exceptional wheels as the XL98R and with the ability to mount Speed Reducers and XL style brakes it’s no wonder that this is now one of our best selling skis.', 5970.00),

(6, '900 SERIES', NULL, 'This very popular classic ski has been in our lineup since the 1990’s and is still a favorite of many skiers. The 900 series utilize an aluminum shaft and composite polymer fork and fender that easily accepts the ATRA speed reducer and doubles as a fender for wet conditions. Available in 3 rolling resistances and 1 combi model, the 910 is slow, the 920 medium-slow and the 930 medium. The preferred model for the average skier is the 930 and for World Cup skiers the 910.', 9270.00),

Because the Speed Reducers are so effective on the Aero the skis have become popular in very hilly or mountainous terrain. The XL125RC is a very stable classic ski with two 125mm pneumatic wheels in the back and a 150mm one way clutch wheel in the front making it very easy to balance on. The pneumatic wheels make it ideal for hard packed dirt roads and bike paths and are exceptionally smooth on pavement. The large pneumatic wheels combined with the stable three-wheeled platform make it a very good choice for beginning classic skiers.', 12270.00),
(6, 'XL900', NULL, 'The XL900 series classic skis are an all aluminum version of the 900 series that incorporate our XL style forks, which have predrilled holes and built in pem standoffs for easy mounting of the XL style brakes and speed reducers. Additionally the front forks incorporate our wheel alignment lever, which makes for very easy tracking adjustments. Available in 3 rolling resistances, the 910 is slow, the 920 medium-slow and the 930 medium. The preferred model for the average skier is the 930 and for World Cup skiers the 910.', 10170.00),
(6, 'XL9848', NULL, 'A Contemporary Terra ski. The old Terra was stable and could be used on both paved and on hard packed dirt roads. However, we were forced to discontinue the Terra as our wheel supplier was unable to provide product in a predictable manner. The Terra was Kristina Smigun’s favorite classic ski. She was a double Olympic Gold medalist in 2006 and after giving birth to daughter Victoria in 2008, and not racing for two seasons, she captured Olympic Silver in 2010. An amazing skier and wonderful person. Many skiers told me the Terra was too heavy for proper training, but Olympic results show otherwise. Just like Kristina, two other Olympic medalists used the Terra for classic training. In the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Olympics Kristina and her Terra training ski mates captured four Gold, one Silver and one Bronze medal. Kristina told me the Terra made her stronger than training on lighter smaller wheel classic skis. We began to ship the XL9848 in April of 2011 and it’s turning out to be one of our best selling classic skis. This season the XL9848 is only available with an aluminum shaft, but when we have increased composite capacity we might be able to offer the XL9848 with a composite shaft. With the wide wheels it’s stable and the 98 mm wheels provide a comfortable ride. It’s also safer than smaller wheel skis as the larger wheels can roll over objects that stop the 70 to 80 mm wheels. Like all XL skis this model accepts the lighter and less expensive XL type Brake.', 10170.00),
(6, 'XL98RC', NULL, 'This classic ski is very stable and is a great choice for beginning classic skiers or someone looking for a stable, 3 wheeled classic ski for good pavement. In the front we use a 100mm split-rim clutch wheel and in the back we use the same durable 100mm free wheels as our XL98R and XL98SL. Another benefit is that the narrow front wheel is less likely to stop dead when encountering debris in the road.', 11370.00),
(6, 'XLC900', NULL, 'Our composite shaft classic and combi ski for paved surfaces offers the most on snow like feel of any classic ski on the market. A lightweight laminate wood core is combined with both unidirectional and biaxial carbon fiber providing a very strong yet lightweight shaft that drastically reduces road vibration and combined with the slight camber provides a truly snow ski like feel. Available in 3 rolling resistances, the 910 is slow, the 920 medium-slow and the 930 medium. The preferred model for the average skier is the 930 and for World Cup skiers the 910', 11670.00),
(6, 'XLC9848', NULL, 'The all-new composite version of the XL9848 “Terra” classic ski. Designed for rough pavement and dirt paths and trails, the composite version provides excellent vibration dampening offering a smoother and quieter ride than the aluminum version. Additionally the composite shafts slight degree of camber and flex offers skiers a livelier and more active ski making it that much closer to skiing on snow. Like all XL skis this model accepts speed reducers and a brake.', 11670.00),

(5, '940C', '940c.jpg', 'Combi skis are a compromise, but the 940C has been very popular, especially with High School and College students who often cannot afford two pair of skis. The rear wheel is harder than the rubber in the classic skis because the scrubbing motion in skating reduces tire life. The front ratchet wheel is narrower than the wheel used on the 900 classic skis and has a more crowned profile for better skate characteristics. The result is a ski that performs exceptionally well for both classic and skate skiing. The 940C has been in our lineup for several years and is still one of our best sellers', 10470.00),
